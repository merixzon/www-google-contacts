=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WWW::Google::Contacts;

    my $google = WWW::Google::Contacts->new( username => "your.username", password => "your.password" );

    my $contact = $google->new_contact;
    $contact->full_name("Emmett Brown");

A lot of fields, such as email, phone number and so on, are accessible as array refs.

    foreach my $email (@{ $contact->email }) {
       print "He got email address: " . $email->value . "\n";
    }

When you have made changes to your contact, you need to save them back to Google. This is done either
by a B<create> call (for new contacts) or an B<update> call (for existing contacts).

    $contact->create;

Alternatively, you can use the B<create_or_update> method, which will do the right thing.

    $contact->create_or_update;


=head1 METHODS

=head2 $contact->create

Writes the contact to your Google account.

=head2 $contact->retrieve

Fetches contact details from Google account.

=head2 $contact->update

Updates existing contact in your Google account.

=head2 $contact->delete

Deletes contact from your Google account.

=head2 $contact->create_or_update

Creates or updates contact, depending on if it already exists.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

All these attributes are gettable and settable on Contact objects.

=head2 given_name

 $contact->given_name("Arnold");

=head2 additional_name

 $contact->additional_name("J");

=head2 family_name

 $contact->family_name("Rimmer");

=head2 name_prefix

 $contact->name_prefix("Mrs");

=head2 name_suffix

 $contact->name_suffix("III");

=head2 full_name

If this is set to what seems like "$given_name $family_name", those attributes will be automatically set.

=head2 email

$contact->email is, if defined, an array reference with 1 or more Email objects.
The Email objects have the following accessors;

=over 4

=item type

This is an object in itself, which has 2 accessors; B<name> and B<uri>.

=item label

If you don't want to use the predefined types (defined by Google) you can set this label instead.

=item value

The email address.

=item display_name

An optional display name.

=item primary

A boolean stating whether this is the primary email address.

=back

Example code (set the first work email as the primary address):

 foreach my $email (@{ $contact->email }) {
   if ( $email->type->name eq 'work' ) {
     $email->primary(1);
     last;
   }
 }


Explicitly setting all email details:

 $contact->email({
   type => "work",
   value => 'shenanigans@example.com',
   display_name => 'Shenanigans',
   primary => 1,
 });

Note that this will overwrite any previous email addresses for the contact. To add rather than replace,
see I<add_email> below.

If you're just setting the email value, type will default to "work" and leave other fields empty.

 $contact->email( 'smeghead@reddwarf.net' );

To specify several email addresses, you could either;

=over 4

=item * provide them all in an array

 $contact->email([
    { type => "work", value => 'underpaid@bigcompany.com' },
    { type => "home", value => 'angryblogger@someblogsite.com' },
 ]);

=item * call add_email

 $contact->add_email( 'homer@simpson.name' );

=back

=head2 phone_number

$contact->phone_number is, if defined, an array reference with 1 or more PhoneNumber objects.
The PhoneNumber objects have the following accessors;

=over 4

=item type

This is an object in itself, which has 2 accessors; B<name> and B<uri>.

=item label

If you don't want to use the predefined types (defined by Google) you can set this label instead.

=item value

The phone number

=back


Explicitly setting all phone details:

 $contact->phone_number({
   type => "mobile",
   value => "+449812323",
 });

Just setting the value will set type to default value "mobile".

 $contact->phone_number( "+1666666" );

To specify several phone numbers, you could either;

=over 4

=item * provide them all in an array

 $contact->phone_number([
    { type => "mobile", value => "12345" },
    { type => "home", value => "666" },
 ]);

=item * call add_phone_number

 });

=back

Local addresses may differ in layout from general addresses, and frequently use local script (as opposed to Latin script) as well, though local script is allowed in general addresses. Unless specified general usage is assumed.

=item primary

Boolean. Specifies the address as primary.

=item agent

The agent who actually receives the mail. Used in work addresses. Also for 'in care of' or 'c/o'.

=item house_name

Used in places where houses or buildings have names (and not necessarily numbers), eg. "The Pillars".

=item street

Can be street, avenue, road, etc. This element also includes the house number and room/apartment/flat/floor number.

=item pobox

Covers actual P.O. boxes, drawers, locked bags, etc. This is usually but not always mutually exclusive with street.

=item neighborhood

This is used to disambiguate a street address when a city contains more than one street with the same name, or to specify a small place whose mail is routed through a larger postal town. In China it could be a county or a minor city.

=item city

Can be city, village, town, borough, etc. This is the postal town and not necessarily the place of residence or place of business.

=item subregion

Handles administrative districts such as U.S. or U.K. counties that are not used for mail addressing purposes. Subregion is not intended for delivery addresses.

=item region

A state, province, county (in Ireland), Land (in Germany), departement (in France), etc.

=item postcode

Postal code. Usually country-wide, but sometimes specific to the city (e.g. "2" in "Dublin 2, Ireland" addresses).

=item country

The name or code of the country.

=item formatted

The full, unstructured postal address.

=back

=head1 INTERACTION WITH GROUPS

Contacts can belong to 0 or more groups. This section describes how to get and set group memberships.

=head2 $contact->groups

Returns an array reference of all groups, as L<WWW::Google::Contacts::Group> objects.

=head2 $contact->add_group_membership( group )

The I<group> argument can either be:

=over 4

=item An L<WWW::Google::Contacts::Group> object

=item The ID of a group, as a URL

=item The name of a group

=back

Do note that the group has to exist on the Google servers before you can add this membership.
